XGridManage
========

xgridmanage is a script designed to create a more user friendly
wrapper to the OSX xgrid command line interface.  The script
itself is written in Python, but the 'install' (it doesn't really
install anything) is written in bash.  I wrote this project to 
help out one of my professors and a research student of his.
These scripts are distributed with no warrently; use at your own
risk.  If you modify/redistribute any code I ask that you please
leave my name at the top.

This project (at the time of writing is hosted on github)

Installation
=============

xgridmanage does not need to be installed, however a simple script
is provided that copies it into a directory named '~/path' and
updates either your .bashrc file or .bash_profile file to include
that directory in your PATH environment variable.

To run the setup script, cd into the same directory as it and run

sh ./setup.sh

Usage
========

xgridmanage takes command line arguments using the -f and --flag
notation.  For a list of accepted commands run 'xgridmanage -h'
or 'xgridmanage --help' or just 'xgridmanage' with no options at all!

Config File
========

The xgrid installation that this script was designed to integrate
with requires a host and password be specified.  These options are
specified in a file named .xgridmanagerc and should be places in
your home directory.  The syntax for this file is as follows:

HOSTNAME localhost
PASSWORD mysecretpassword

A sample config file is provided with the rest of the files.
