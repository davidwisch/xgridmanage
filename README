XGridManage
========

xgridmanage is a script designed to create a more user friendly
wrapper to the OSX xgrid command line interface.  I wrote this project to
help out one of my professors and a research student of his.

This project (at the time of writing is hosted on github)

http://github.com/davidwisch/xgridmanage


Installation
=============

xgridmanage does not need to be installed, however a simple script
is provided that copies it into a directory named '~/path' and
updates either your .bashrc file or .bash_profile file to include
that directory in your PATH environment variable.

To run the setup script, cd into the same directory as it and run

sh ./setup.sh

Usage
========

xgridmanage takes command line arguments using the -f and --flag
notation.  For a list of accepted commands run 'xgridmanage -h'
or 'xgridmanage --help' or just 'xgridmanage' with no options at all!

When you submit a job to the xgrid, a file called submit_ids is created.
This file is what stores the job ids for everything that was just
deployed - don't delete it.  This is the file you'll want to pass
back to xgridmanage to retrieve all your results (and to delete those
jobs from xgrid).

//Submit program.bin to 10 machines
xgridmanage -n 10 -d program.bin

//find status of all program.bin jobs
xgridmanage -s submit_ids

//retrieve results for program.bin
xgridmanage -b submit_ids

//delete all program.bin jobs
xgridmanage -f submit_ids

Other options can be found by typing 'xgridmanage -h'

Results
========

When you retrieve results from xgrid, they're placed in a RESULTS folder.
This folder contains two types of files, text files that contain the 
stdoutput for the jobs you retrieved, and directories containing any output
files those jobs may have been created.

The files containing the stdout are of the form "id_[job_id]_stdout"
The folders containing output files are of the form id_[job_id]

Where in both of the above examples '[job_id]' is replaced by the actual job id.

Config File
============

The xgrid installation that this script was designed to integrate
with requires a host and password be specified.  These options are
specified in a file named .xgridmanagerc and should be places in
your home directory.  The syntax for this file is as follows:

HOSTNAME localhost
PASSWORD mysecretpassword

A sample config file is provided with the rest of the files.
The real config filename must be named .xgridmanagerc
